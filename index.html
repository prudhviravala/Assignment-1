    Frontend Technologies

</h2>
<p>Popular front end technologies
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three cornerstone technologies in front end development. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used for structuring content on the web, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript is used to make webpages interactive.</p>
    <h3>
        Html
    </h3>
    <p>HTML is the universal markup language for the Web. HTML lets you format text, add graphics, create links, input forms, frames and tables, etc., and save it all in a text file that any browser can read and display. For more information on HTML, please take a look at our HTML examples and our HTML reference.</p>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.</p>
<h2>Backend Technologies</h2>

<p>Backend technologies refer to the tools, frameworks, languages, and databases used to build the server side of web applications. These technologies work behind the scenes, managing the server, databases, and the application logic that facilitates communication between the server and the end user's browser (front end).</p>
<h3>Node.js</h3>
<p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.</p>
<h3>Django</h3>
<p>Django is an open-source framework based on Python. It is a web framework from the serverâ€™s side. Django follows the Model Template View (MTV) architecture. It focuses on the reuse of code, an easy and fast development process with minimal coupling. This allows the developers to look at and learn about any functionality in an easy way instead of searching it online.</p>

<h3>Spring boot</h3>
<p>Spring Boot is an open-source web framework based on Java that allows developers to build production-grade and standalone applications. It is free to use. It makes use of a micro-framework that helps in developing microservices for websites and mobile applications.</p>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>Databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB are used to store and manage data for applications.</p>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Python is a versatile programming language often used for server-side development, known for its simplicity and readability.</p>
